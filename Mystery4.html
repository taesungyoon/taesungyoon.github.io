      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class = "books_title_details">The Decagon House Murders is a 1987 Japanese mystery novel, the debut work of author Yukito Ayatsuji. <br>Borrowing its basic plot structure from Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None (Christie's book is directly referenced by some of the characters at several points), it tells the story of a group of seven university students who travel to a deserted island that was the scene of a grisly mass murder six months earlier, where events soon turn ominous. <br>The Decagon House Murders belongs to the honkaku subgenre of mystery fiction.<br><br>
        Locked Room International published the first English-language edition of the novel in 2015. The second English-language edition was published in December 2020 by Pushkin Press, and in July 2021 the manga adaptation, illustrated by Hiro Kiyohara, was announced for publication in America.</p>
