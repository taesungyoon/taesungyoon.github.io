      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class = "books_title_details">Les  Misérables is a French historical novel by Victor Hugo, first published in 1862, that is considered one of the greatest novels of the 19th century.<br> Les Misérables has been popularized through numerous adaptations for film, television and the stage, including a musical.<br>
        <br>
        In the English-speaking world, the novel is usually referred to by its original French title.<br> However, several alternatives have been used, including The Miserables, The Wretched, The Miserable Ones, The Poor Ones, The Wretched Poor, The Victims, and The Dispossessed.<br> Beginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, the novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict Jean Valjean and his experience of redemption.<br>
        <br>
        Examining the nature of law and grace, the novel elaborates upon the history of France, the architecture and urban design of Paris, politics, moral philosophy, antimonarchism, justice, religion, and the types and nature of romantic and familial love.
