      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class = "books_title_details">
An A.I. that learned to play chess discovered moves that no human champion would have conceived of.<br> Driverless cars edge forward at red lights, just like impatient humans, and so far, nobody can explain why it happens.<br> Artificial intelligence is being put to use in sports, medicine, education, and even (frighteningly) how we wage war.<br><br>

In this book, three of our most accomplished and deep thinkers come together to explore how A.I. could affect our relationship with knowledge, impact our worldviews, and change society and politics as profoundly as the ideas of the Enlightenment.
