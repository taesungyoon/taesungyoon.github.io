      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class = "books_title_details">A popular young girl disappears without a trace, her skeletal remains discovered three years later in the ashes of a burned out house. <br>There’s a suspect and compelling circumstantial evidence of his guilt, but no concrete proof. <br>When he isn’t indicted, he returns to mock the girl’s family. <br>And this isn’t the first time he’s been suspected of the murder of a young girl, nearly twenty years ago he was tried and released due to lack of evidence. <br>Detective Chief Inspector Kusanagi of the Homicide Division of the Tokyo Police worked both cases.
        <br> The neighborhood in which the murdered girl lived is famous for an annual street festival, featuring a parade with entries from around Tokyo and Japan. During the parade, the suspected killer dies unexpectedly. <br>His death is suspiciously convenient but the people with all the best motives have rock solid alibis. <br>DCI Kusanagi turns once again to his college friend, Physics professor and occasional police consultant Manabu Yukawa, known as Detective Galileo, to help solve the string of impossible-to-prove murders.</p>
