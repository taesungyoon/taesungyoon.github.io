      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class = "books_title_details">Snow Country is a novel by the Japanese author Yasunari Kawabata. <br>The novel is considered a classic work of Japanese literature and was among the three novels the Nobel Committee cited in 1968, when Kawabata was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>
      At an isolated mountain hot spring, with snow blanketing every surface, Shimamura, a wealthy dilettante meets Komako, a lowly geisha. She gives herself to him fully and without remorse, despite knowing that their passion cannot last and that the affair can have only one outcome.<br> In chronicling the course of this doomed romance, Kawabata has created a story for the agesâ€”a stunning novel dense in implication and exalting in its sadness.
