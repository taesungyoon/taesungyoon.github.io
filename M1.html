      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class = "books_title_details">TOP Maths series is developed to cover comprehensively the learning objectives of the latest Cambridge Primary Mathematics curriculum framework.<br> TOP Maths builds a strong foundation of the subject through the use of well-researched and sound pedagogical principles. <br>Adopting a Concrete Pictorial Abstract approach, pupils are introduced to new concepts through concrete manipulatives and engaging pictorials before they are led to see their abstract representations.<br> This allows pupils to have a deeper understanding of key mathematical concepts, thus motivating them to learn. <br>Content is also clearly structured and spiralled across the levels to ensure a gradual build-up and review of skills as pupils progress up the stages. <br>At the same time, emphasis is given on developing pupils’ problem-solving skills, critical thinking, as well as other 21st century skills.<br> TOP Maths also develops pupils’ confidence. <br>A wide variety of practice questions are provided at frequent and appropriate junctures. <br>This ensures that there is immediate reinforcement of concepts and sufficient practice for pupils.<br><br> TOP Maths Stage 6 comprises the following components: Textbooks 6A and 6B Workbooks 6A and 6B Teacher’s Guides 6A and 6B — Contain detailed mapping to the Cambridge curriculum framework, wraparound teachers’ notes for Textbooks and answers for Workbooks, with additional information and tips on conducting and delivering effective mathematics lessons</p>
